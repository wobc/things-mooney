## Definitions

- **Semantic distance**: A measure of how distant two concepts are in a given semantic space, using [openly available semantic embeddings](https://osf.io/jum2f/) derived from large text corpora. Low semantic distance means that participant-provided labels were close in semantic space to the target label, i.e. donkey and horse.
- **Entropy**: A measure of variability in the set of labels used to describe an image, considering the amount and frequencies of different guesses. Low entropy means participants used a small and consistent set of labels to descirbe an image.
- **Information gain**: The reduction in semantic distance or uncertainty (entropy) after exposure to a stimulus, i.e. the greyscale image.
